        How to Prevent Foot Fungus
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Foot fungus is a common condition caused by moisture, warmth,
        and fungal growth on the skin. Fortunately, it can be prevented
        with proper daily foot care.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Keep your feet clean and dry, especially between the toes.
        Always dry your feet thoroughly after washing or sweating.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Wear breathable shoes, change socks daily, and avoid walking
        barefoot in public areas such as pools or locker rooms.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        If you notice itching, redness, or peeling skin, early treatment
        and professional foot care can help prevent the condition from worsening.
