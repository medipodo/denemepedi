        What Causes Foot Odor?
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Foot odor is a common condition caused by excessive sweating and the
        growth of bacteria on the feet. When sweat accumulates inside shoes,
        bacteria break it down and produce unpleasant smells.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Poor ventilation, wearing the same shoes daily, synthetic socks,
        and inadequate foot hygiene can all worsen foot odor.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Washing feet daily, drying them thoroughly, wearing breathable shoes,
        and changing socks regularly can significantly reduce foot odor.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Persistent foot odor may indicate an underlying fungal infection.
        In such cases, professional foot care is recommended.
